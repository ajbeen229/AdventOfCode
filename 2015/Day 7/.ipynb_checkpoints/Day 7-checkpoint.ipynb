    "# Day 7: Some Assembly Required\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, Santa brought little Bobby Tables a set of wires and bitwise logic gates! Unfortunately, little Bobby is a little under the recommended age range, and he needs help assembling the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each wire has an identifier (some lowercase letters) and can carry a 16-bit signal (a number from 0 to 65535). A signal is provided to each wire by a gate, another wire, or some specific value. Each wire can only get a signal from one source, but can provide its signal to multiple destinations. A gate provides no signal until all of its inputs have a signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The included instructions booklet describes how to connect the parts together: `x AND y -> z` means to connect wires x and y to an AND gate, and then connect its output to wire z.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `123 -> x` means that the signal 123 is provided to wire x.\n",
    "* `x AND y -> z` means that the bitwise AND of wire x and wire y is provided to wire z.\n",
    "* `p LSHIFT 2 -> q` means that the value from wire p is left-shifted by 2 and then provided to wire q.\n",
    "* `NOT e -> f` means that the bitwise complement of the value from wire e is provided to wire f.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other possible gates include OR (bitwise OR) and RSHIFT (right-shift). If, for some reason, you'd like to emulate the circuit instead, almost all programming languages (for example, C, JavaScript, or Python) provide operators for these gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is a simple circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    "`123 -> x`  \n",
    "`456 -> y`  \n",
    "`x AND y -> d`  \n",
    "`x OR y -> e`  \n",
    "`x LSHIFT 2 -> f`  \n",
    "`y RSHIFT 2 -> g`  \n",
    "`NOT x -> h`  \n",
    "`NOT y -> i`  \n",
    "\n",
    "After it is run, these are the signals on the wires:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`d: 72`  \n",
    "`e: 507`  \n",
    "`f: 492`  \n",
    "`g: 114`  \n",
    "`h: 65412`  \n",
    "`i: 65079`  \n",
    "`x: 123`  \n",
    "`y: 456`\n",
    "\n",
    "In little Bobby's kit's instructions booklet (provided as your puzzle input), **what signal is ultimately provided to `wire a`**?"
